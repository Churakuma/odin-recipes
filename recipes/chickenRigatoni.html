        <li>1 Pack of Rigatoni Pasta</li>
        <li>500g Skinless, boneless chicken breasts (diced)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup of water</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup fresh sliced mushroom</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup chopped marinated artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot with water and 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil. Cook Rigatoni
            in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite,
             about 10 minutes. Drain and reserve some of the pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine salt, Italian seasoning and black peper in a bowl. Add 
            chicken pieces and toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet until it shimmers. Add chicken pieces and cook 
            until browned, about 5 minutes. You might be tempted to add more olive oil 
            or butter, DON'T do this.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in reserved pasta water and add mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sun-dried 
            tomatoes, and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in cream and cheese. Whisk until sauce is slightly thickened. Add rigatoni 
            and toss to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
